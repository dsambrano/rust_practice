# My Journey through Rust

Given the NSA's new [report][nsa-report] recommending programmers switch from memory unsafe lanuages like C/C++ to memory safe lanuages like Rust and Rust's popularity ([Linux added it to its Kernel][rust-linux]), I figured now was as good a time as any to check out Rust.
I have been thinking about people up a complied lanuage for a long time, and it looks like Rust is the future so here I go!

This repo will have my projects as I go through my rust journey.
I am starting off with [this tutorial][rust-mit] if you want to follow along, and after the first lesson, I am already super excited!
To get some extra practice, after I get the hang of the basics, I will probably start doing the [Advent of Code][aoc] challenges for some extra practice.


Lesson 1:
Holy crap its awesome!
```rust
cargo new --bin PATH
```
creates all the basic directories and initializes the `git` repo.
Amazing!

<!--I need to think if I want this to be a blog (seems like maybe... ohhh nvm a post linking to this. otherwise would take way to many posts. That way I can post here much more frequently and add the when I want to).-->
<!--Should have a simlar separate directory to ml and (kaggle?)-->
